# Plan a Bike Trip

## Project Description
This project is my solo adaption of a previous collaboration, [Find a Divvy Bike](https://ruthhinkle.github.io/project-2/index.html). Like the original project, this adaption allows users tap into a city's bikeshare program and locate a bike for their use. 

## Objectives
Go to [our website](https://ruthhinkle.github.io/project-2/index.html) to plan your trip.

<details> <summary markdown="span"><strong> üìç Check Station Status</strong></summary>
  To find a bike, check nearby stations and look at their status to see if there are bikes available. Light-blue pins indicate  stations full of bikes, dark-blue pins indicate stations with less than 5 bikes, and red pins indicate empty stations. When you're done with your ride, red stations are great place to drop off your bike.
</details>

<details> <summary markdown="span"><strong>üîé Table View</strong></summary>
    Navigate to the (table tab)[https://ruthhinkle.github.io/project-2/table] for a different view! You can search a street name to locate all of the stations on that street."
</details>


## Future Upgrades
* Reconcile the conflict between MarkerClusterGroups and layer toggles for Full, Low, and Empty stations
* Design a neutral template to be used with GBFS data from any other city following that data standard

<strong>To run on your local machine, clone this repository.</strong> No extra installation is necessary.

If you do run into issues, check the installation and file requirements for the following libraries: 
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
* [Leaflet MarkerCluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster) by [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet)

If you can't reconcile installation issues, let us know!
